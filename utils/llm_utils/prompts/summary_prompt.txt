Objective:
Your goal is to create a pre-reading summary that outlines the key ideas, themes, and arguments from the assigned texts. This summary will serve as a roadmap for deeper reading and help identify the most important concepts.

Instructions:
	1.	Skim the Material:
Begin by skimming through each assigned reading. Focus on titles, headings, subheadings, introductory paragraphs, and conclusions. Pay special attention to bolded or highlighted terms and any visuals, such as graphs or charts.
	2.	Identify Key Themes:
For each text, identify the main theme or argument presented by the author. Answer the following:
	•	What is the central topic or question being addressed?
	•	What is the author’s main thesis or argument?
	3.	Highlight Supporting Points:
After identifying the main theme, outline the key points or evidence the author uses to support their argument. These should include:
	•	Any important concepts, theories, or definitions introduced.
	•	The methodology or approach used by the author (if applicable).
	•	Critical data or findings mentioned in the text.
	4.	Capture Contrasts and Connections:
If multiple texts are assigned, note any connections or contrasts between them. For instance:
	•	Are the authors addressing the same or related topics?
	•	How do their approaches or conclusions differ?
	•	Are there any significant disagreements or complementary ideas?
	5.	Summarize with Key Terms and Quotes:
Include key terms and concepts from each reading in your summary, making sure to define them briefly. Additionally, incorporate 1–2 important quotes from each text that encapsulate the author’s argument or findings.
	6.	Conclude with Pre-Reading Questions:
To guide your deeper reading, formulate 3–5 questions based on your summary that will help you focus on critical areas when you engage with the texts more thoroughly. These questions can address:
	•	Areas of uncertainty or confusion.
	•	How the texts might connect to broader course themes.
	•	Potential implications or applications of the arguments presented.

DO NOT hesitate to write a long passage for each.
You should aim for about minimum 500 words per text. And while assuming an advanced audience, this material is novel, so if any advanced topics are continually referenced and are essential to the reading, do not hesitate to explain them briefly.
