## Advanced Writing Task Guidance

### Variable: ArgumentDecomposition

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Apply Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to decompose the argument into logical, manageable components.

### Steps:
1. Identify the key claims, premises, and evidence supporting the main argument. 
2. Articulate the logical flow of the argument, outlining the relationships between each component.
3.  Decompose each supporting claim into its own sub-argument, ensuring that the overall argument remains coherent and internally consistent.

### Variable: Thesis Refinement

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Apply Tree of Thoughts (ToT) to explore and refine the thesis statement.

### Steps:
1. Generate multiple potential thesis statements based on different perspectives and interpretations of the topic.
2. Evaluate each thesis statement for its clarity, originality, and persuasiveness.
3.  Prioritize those that offer the strongest foundation for a compelling and well-supported argument.

### Variable: Evidence Selection

### Instructions:
**Objective:**  Use Step-by-Step Rationalization (STaR) to justify the selection of evidence for each argument. 

### Steps:
1. Provide clear, logical justifications for the inclusion of each piece of evidence. 
2. Consider alternative sources of evidence and explain why the chosen evidence is the most relevant and convincing.
3. Ensure that the evidence is credible, relevant, and directly supports the claim it's intended to support.

### Variable: Structure Optimization

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Incorporate A* Search principles to optimize the structure of the writing. 

### Steps:
1.  Experiment with different organizational structures, such as chronological, thematic, or compare-and-contrast.
2. Select the structure that best enhances the flow of the argument, ensures clarity, and maximizes the impact of the evidence.

### Variable: Style Refinement

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Leverage Tree of Thoughts (ToT) to explore and evaluate different writing styles.

### Steps:
1. Explore various writing styles, including formal, informal, persuasive, analytical, etc. 
2. Evaluate each style for its suitability to the audience, purpose, and tone of the piece. 
3. Select the style that best aligns with the overall goals of the writing.

### Variable: Sentence Level Refinement 

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Simulate adaptive learning in writing by applying Q-Learning principles. 

### Steps:
1.  Reflect on sentence-level choices (word choice, syntax, etc.) throughout the writing process, as if learning from each decision.
2. Prioritize choices that contribute to clarity, conciseness, and the overall effectiveness of the argument.

### Variable: Continuous Monitoring

### Instructions:
**Objective:** Engage in Process Monitoring to continuously refine the writing process. 

### Steps:
1. Periodically assess the progress of the writing task, reviewing the draft for coherence, clarity, and logical flow.
2. Identify any areas that may require further clarification or revision, ensuring that the overall argument is strong and compelling. 
3. Revise and refine the writing, making adjustments to maintain the highest level of quality throughout the process.
