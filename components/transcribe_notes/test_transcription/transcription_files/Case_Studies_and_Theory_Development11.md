# Ch. 8 - Comparative Methods

Approximating statistic experiments

b) Controlled comparison (1971) the most famous are:

Extremely difficult 
**MNV** method essentially by splitting up exp. or disp. vars. further ... puts a black box around pre-ex..
Mill's third: concomitant variations - essentially just 4 groups 
Even Mill was doubt fil - Equifinality problem. 

## Method of Agreement: Identify a similarity is Ind. Var. among hey exp. w/ ...
## Method of Difference: Ind. Vars. associated w. Diff. outcomes in ype w/ 
Assumptions: 1. Deterministic regularity

2. No DMVs
3. Cases represent full range of possible causes 

Multiple caus can... small n â†’ Mill Unworkable.

Maybe identifying neither sufficient nor necessary vars? but that's not super useful as Equifinality prompts it.

Typological Theories (as "Sol." to Config. W. o/ o/ o/ other H2O)
of Equifinality
**OCA** reaching Some GSS complications
Before/After a method of switching comparing method
  -> Prob. Several Vars. may change in num. of shifts.

Sol:  process tracing on all caus' valid.
Then check change at shifting critical junctures (Collier)

Finding imagining as most on-point 
Counter factual imagining 
Has to be pretty strong.
