**Namier**:

That poor Othello repeatedly entranced by the voodoo through the Iago Academia is. It's a story of wholeheartedly placing faith in academia, even when time and time again it sours the relationship and awards prestige to mediocre talents.

Followed Mach's 'economy of  thought' down to Freud and viewed history thus. Aligned with the Viennese and wielded it as a weapon against those encroaching the subject with the prospect of the history of ideas.

-> 'taking the mind out of history' in a **constructive-destructive** movement

A sort of pointillisme - splitting canvas up into the microscopic details of individual lives. But he used the method geniously and never let the vision of the trees obscure the forest like so many others.
