# Voting Systems: Theory

We explore w/ Social choice theory by comparing diff. Voting Systems and understanding the Trade-offs

- Both functionality and desirability
- **(I) Setting up preferences** a single more and pref. slope down elsewhere.
- Simplifying assumptions: single-peaked preference.
- To this, it can be simplified to w/ 0-line.
- Putting public good: $g_i$  en iterated.
- Prefs. could be $u_i = (g_i - b_i)^2$. 
- $b_i$ : individual's bliss point.
A diagram depicting a curve with a peak at $b_i$ on the x-axis and a line sloping downward from $b_i$ on the x-axis.
- Underscoring why single-peaked makes sense.
- **(II) Using our model analytically**: Exact b.c. of monotonicity.
- Incredible useful model for Mean Vote Theorem (1407).
- **I.e. MVT** holds. 
- If there's two candidates: single-peaked preferences
- Holds exactly under 1. (Analytically demonstrable MVT)
- 2. The intensity of preference shouldn't matter.
- (Thus,  Dom.  similarly requires that we might consider other (Arrow)
- The intensity of votes
- **(III)  Curerent Cycles**
- Cycle-Violation of transitivity is well established.
- **Condorcet Cycle** precludes a Condorcet Cycle winner.
- MVT  provides example of a Cond. Winner,  Cond. Paradox. 
- Cond. Paradox is used in agenda setting; sequence of votes etc.
- (Arrow) Inp. Theorem
- Thus there is no right answer in the Inter-pretation.
- Here is no right answer.

- As soon as we introduce 3. or lower methods.
-  .. credible commitments at Majority
- ..  that we ought consider
-  ..  the intensity of preferences
-  ..  ..  so  in preference
-  ..  ..  ..  we might consider
