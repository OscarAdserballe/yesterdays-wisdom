# Embedded Liberalism 14

Fred Block's Intro to Polanyi's "The Great Transformation"

Focus on *that* - what actually *regulates* global econ.

**Q:** why did *certain* periods of peace and prosperity (1915-1919) if-regulating

**(I)** Industrialization *could* depict "Market Liberalism"

-> England as "workshop of the world" as organizing principle.

**(II)** Produces *domestic* *self-reg.* to protect society

(from market -> organizing principle. Cells and tissues rise

Central to this explanation is this: Equilibrating sys. of wages/share rights.)

**L:** Embedded Liberalism

Always: Solutions to social realms & society &c.

And *disembedding* Cannot be successful.

This is the *gas* of his case study in 1915-1919.

Why not? - *Fictitious Commodity*

Land, Labor as *autonomous* commodities.  It's a *mechanism* that they will *behave* in the same way.

Two eras:

-  Murrel: Sacred needs

-  Pragmatic: An impossible belief's got eg. deflation, etc.

*Laissez Faire* always *premised* always on artificial

Creation - Gold Standard appears as "a fantastic

mechanism" of *global self-regulation.*  But it

*New Deal* policies appear as the models themselves, and 

Suppose *Market mechanisms* give them *power*, and

we cannot let *governance* be a technocratic chaos.
