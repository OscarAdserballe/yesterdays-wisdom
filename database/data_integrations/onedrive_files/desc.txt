This is my base code I programmed for antoher app, which works quite well at parsing a small local context in some directory, now my use case is slighyl broader. What I need is the following:

I need a fileparser that starts in the LOCAL_FILES_PATH and goes through every single file in it, and each subdirectoy etc. all the way down. For each file I'd liek to store all relevant metadata about it, and more importantly, the text data contained in it. Importantly, it should use the same logic here of parsing it with tika and create a .txt file the first time it parses through it. INstead of the current functionality, it should store the .txt file elsewhere in a "Parsed Files" Directory where the filepath of a given file is hashed such that it can also be found again. This is is to ensure we don't have to do the relatively expensive operations of parsing them again. THe validation of file extensions should also be a bit broader considreing it's my whole filebase.
